## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, 
For the dataset given, there was an interesting interaction in the categorical day of week, there were more trips taken on workdays than weekends. 
I verified the relationship between subscription and frequency of trips taken and its average duration, Subscribers take less time in a trip than a regular customer, however looking at the frequency of trips taken by subscribers to customer contradicts my surprise.
> Outside of the main variables of interest, , I found that there was a strong relationship between age and the average duration a biker takes to complete a trip, peak trips at age of teenagers to mid 30's.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the influence of Age, Weekdays, and Subscription on the frequency of trips taken and its duration. I start by introducing the frequency of trips against different variables, frequency of trips against age, followed by the frequency of trips against weekdays, then plotting the average duration of trips for subscribers and customers.
Afterwards, I introduce a scatterplot showing the distribution of duration of trips against age for each gender.
I've made sure to use different color palettes for each gender variable to make sure it is clear.
